        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        I am interested in developing scalable software solutions and tackling real-world problems. My main areas of interest include frontend development, system design, data structures & algorithms, and AI/ML. I have worked on probabilistic text generation with Python and Markovify to create a Truth & Dare bot for the Discord platform that can generate dynamic and context-aware prompts using Markov chain models.
        </p>

        I find pleasure in learning new technologies and honing my analytical and problem-solving skills by implementing them in real-world scenarios and solving algorithmic problems. I am also actively working on learning new frameworks, scalable system design patterns, and AI/ML concepts to enhance my knowledge in software engineering. My ultimate aim is to develop scalable and user-friendly applications and become a well-rounded full-stack developer with strong system-level thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
        Besides my areas of interest, I also engage in esports and competitive gaming, which enhance my strategic thinking and adaptability. I also enjoy playing the guitar and sports such as football and table tennis. These enable me to remain disciplined, creative, and agile while ensuring that I maintain a balance between my work and personal development.
